Absolutely! Here's a **step-by-step and clearly labeled Activity Diagram for a Railway Management System**, complete with **activities, action states, transitions, decision branches, forking, joining, swimlanes**, and **object usage**.

## 🚆 **Activity Diagram – Railway Management System**

### 🎯 Swimlanes (Roles)

Divide your activity diagram into **swimlanes** (vertical lanes):

| Swimlane             | Actor/Role                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Passenger        | Uses the system to book/manage tickets      |
| 2️⃣ Ticketing System | Handles bookings, payments, status          |
| 3️⃣ Admin/Operator   | Manages schedule, trains, and cancellations |

## 🔁 Activity Flow Breakdown

### ✅ **1. Start**

* Place an **Initial Node (●)** in the **Passenger** swimlane.

---

### ✅ **2. Search Train**

* Add **action state**: `Search Train`
* ⬇️ Transition to: `View Train Schedule`

---

### ✅ **3. Decision: Is Train Available?**

* Add a **Decision Node (◇)**
* From `View Train Schedule` → ⬇️ Decision node

  * **\[Available]** → ➡️ `Select Train`
  * **\[Not Available]** → ➡️ `Show Message: No Train Available` → End

---

### ✅ **4. Proceed to Booking**

* From `Select Train` → ⬇️ `Enter Passenger Details` → `Make Payment`

---

### ✅ **5. Include Object Node**

* After `Make Payment` → ⬇️ **Object Node**: `Payment Receipt`

---

### ✅ **6. Confirm Booking**

* From `Payment Receipt` → `Generate Ticket` → ⬇️ `Send Confirmation` (email/SMS)

---

### ✅ **7. Fork: Parallel Actions**

After sending confirmation:

* Add **Fork Node** (horizontal bar)
* ➡️ Path 1: `Update Seat Availability` (System)
* ➡️ Path 2: `Update Booking History` (System)

---

### ✅ **8. Join and End**

* Both above → ⬇️ **Join Node**
* ⬇️ → `End` node (◎)

---

### ✅ **Optional Admin Side Flow**

In **Admin swimlane**:

* `Login Admin`
* `Modify Train Schedule`
* `Cancel Train`
* `Notify Affected Passengers` (fork/join pattern if parallel)

## 🛠️ How to Build This in StarUML:

1. Create a new **Activity Diagram**
2. Add **Swimlanes** for: Passenger, System, Admin
3. Use:

   * **Initial node (●)** at the top
   * **Action states** (rounded rectangles)
   * **Decision node (◇)** for branching
   * **Object node** (rectangle with <<object>> label)
   * **Fork/Join**: thick horizontal bars
   * **Final node (◎)** at the bottom
4. Label all transitions like `[Available]`, `[Not Available]`, etc.
