**Relationships**:

* Generalization of `TicketAdmin` and `SystemAdmin`

---

#### 10. **TicketAdmin** *(inherits Admin)*

* Attributes:

  * `areaOfAccess: String`
* Operations:

  * `manageTicketBookings()`

---

#### 11. **SystemAdmin** *(inherits Admin)*

* Attributes:

  * `systemRights: String`
* Operations:

  * `manageUserAccounts()`

---

ðŸ’¡ **Short Definitions (for Oral Exam):**

* **Association**: A basic relationship (e.g., Passenger â†” Ticket)
* **Aggregation**: Whole-part where part can exist independently (RailwaySystem â†’ Train)
* **Composition**: Strong whole-part where part can't exist alone (Train â†’ Coach)
* **Generalization**: Inheritance (Admin â†’ TicketAdmin, SystemAdmin)
* **Multiplicity**: Number of instances (e.g., 1..1 to 0..\*)
* **Dependency**: Temporary use (Train â†’ Route for planning)
