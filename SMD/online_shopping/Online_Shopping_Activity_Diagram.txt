Certainly! Here's a **clearly structured Activity Diagram for an Online Shopping System**, with full usage of **activities, action states, transitions, decision branches, forking, joining, objects**, and **swimlanes** so you can recreate it step by step in **StarUML**.

## 🛒 **Activity Diagram – Online Shopping System**

---

### 🎯 **Swimlanes (Roles)**

| Swimlane            | Role                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Customer        | Browses and purchases items              |
| 2️⃣ Shopping System | Handles product, cart, and payment logic |
| 3️⃣ Payment Gateway | Verifies and processes payment           |

---

## 🔁 **Activity Flow Breakdown**

### ✅ **1. Start**

* Add an **Initial Node (●)** in the **Customer** swimlane

---

### ✅ **2. Browse and Add Products**

* `Browse Products` → `View Product Details`
* `Add to Cart`

---

### ✅ **3. View and Modify Cart**

* `View Cart` → `Update Quantity` or `Remove Item`
* ➡️ Then `Proceed to Checkout`

---

### ✅ **4. Decision: Is User Logged In?**

* Add a **Decision Node (◇)** in the system swimlane

  * **\[Yes]** → `Enter Shipping Info`
  * **\[No]** → `Login/Register` → then → `Enter Shipping Info`

---

### ✅ **5. Enter Payment Info**

* After shipping info → `Enter Payment Details`

---

### ✅ **6. Fork: Payment and Order Summary**

* Add a **Fork Node**:

  * ➡️ `Generate Order Summary`
  * ➡️ `Process Payment` (goes to Payment Gateway)

---

### ✅ **7. Join: Payment Completion**

* After both complete → Join at **Join Node** → `Send Confirmation`

---

### ✅ **8. Final Steps**

* `Update Inventory`
* `Send Order to Warehouse`
* `Send Email Notification`
* Then: **Final Node (◎)**

## 🛠️ **How to Build in StarUML**

1. Open a new **Activity Diagram**
2. Add **3 Swimlanes**: Customer, System, Payment Gateway
3. Use:

   * **Initial node (●)** and **Final node (◎)**
   * **Rounded rectangles** for action states
   * **Diamond (◇)** for decision nodes with labels like `[Yes]`, `[No]`
   * **Fork/Join nodes** as **horizontal bars**
   * **Object nodes** (optional): `Cart`, `Order`, `Payment Info`
4. Connect all steps with arrows (transitions)
