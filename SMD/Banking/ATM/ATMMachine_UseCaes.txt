Sure! Here's a complete **Use Case Diagram specification for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) System**, designed for **StarUML**, including **actors**, **8â€“9 use cases**, and **UML relationships** like `<<include>>`, `<<extend>>`, and **generalization**, along with the **system boundary**.

---

### âœ… **Use Case Diagram â€“ ATM Machine System**

#### ðŸ“Œ **Actors:**

* **User**
* **Bank Server (External System)**
* **Technician**
* **Admin**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Use Cases (8â€“9):**

1. Insert Card
2. Authenticate User
3. Withdraw Cash
4. Deposit Cash
5. Check Balance
6. Transfer Funds
7. Print Receipt
8. Eject Card
9. Display Error

---

### ðŸ“Œ **System Boundary:**

*Label as:* **ATM Machine System**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Actorâ€“Use Case Associations:**

* **User** â†’ Insert Card, Authenticate User, Withdraw Cash, Deposit Cash, Check Balance, Transfer Funds, Print Receipt, Eject Card
* **Bank Server** â†’ Authenticate User, Withdraw Cash, Deposit Cash, Check Balance, Transfer Funds
* **Technician** â†’ Display Error
* **Admin** â†’ Display Error

---

### ðŸ“Œ **`<<include>>` Relationships:**

* Withdraw Cash `<<include>>` Authenticate User
* Deposit Cash `<<include>>` Authenticate User
* Transfer Funds `<<include>>` Authenticate User
* Print Receipt `<<include>>` Withdraw Cash
* Eject Card `<<include>>` Print Receipt

---

### ðŸ“Œ **`<<extend>>` Relationships:**

* Display Error `<<extend>>` Withdraw Cash
* Display Error `<<extend>>` Deposit Cash

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Generalization (Optional):**

* **Admin** and **Technician** can be generalized under **Maintenance Staff**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **StarUML Drawing Instructions:**

1. Open StarUML and create a new **Use Case Diagram**
2. Draw the **System Boundary box** and label it **"ATM Machine System"**
3. Place **actors** outside the boundary: User, Bank Server, Technician, Admin
4. Place the **use cases** inside the system boundary (as listed above)
5. Draw **associations (lines)** between actors and their respective use cases
6. Add `<<include>>` and `<<extend>>` relationships
7. Use **generalization** arrow if applying the "Maintenance Staff" abstraction
