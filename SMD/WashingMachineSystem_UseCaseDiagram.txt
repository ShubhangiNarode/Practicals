Use Case Diagram – Washing Machine System

Actors:
- User
- Maintenance Technician
- Admin/System Monitor

Use Cases:
1. Power On/Off
2. Select Wash Mode
3. Start Washing
4. Pause/Resume
5. Set Timer
6. Drain Water
7. Self-Diagnose Fault
8. Display Error
9. Notify Maintenance

System Boundary:
- Washing Machine System

Actor–Use Case Associations:
- User → Power On/Off, Select Wash Mode, Start Washing, Pause/Resume, Set Timer, Drain Water
- Maintenance Technician → Self-Diagnose Fault, Notify Maintenance
- Admin/System Monitor → Display Error, Notify Maintenance

<<include>> Relationships:
- Start Washing <<include>> Select Wash Mode
- Drain Water <<include>> Pause/Resume
- Notify Maintenance <<include>> Display Error

<<extend>> Relationships:
- Self-Diagnose Fault <<extend>> Start Washing
- Display Error <<extend>> Self-Diagnose Fault

Generalization (Optional):
- Admin and Technician can be generalized under "System Operator"

StarUML Drawing Instructions:
1. Open StarUML and create a new Use Case Diagram
2. Add the System Boundary labeled "Washing Machine System"
3. Place actors outside the boundary: User, Maintenance Technician, Admin
4. Place use cases inside the system boundary (as listed above)
5. Connect actors to the use cases with solid lines
6. Use <<include>>, <<extend>>, and generalization arrows where specified
