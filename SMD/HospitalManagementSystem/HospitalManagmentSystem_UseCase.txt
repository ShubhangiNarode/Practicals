Here is a complete **Use Case Diagram description** for a **Hospital Management System** with **8–9 use cases**, ideal for your practical using **StarUML**:

---

### ✅ **Use Case Diagram – Hospital Management System**

#### 📌 **Actors:**

* Patient
* Doctor
* Receptionist
* Admin

---

### 📌 **Use Cases (8–9 total):**

1. Register Patient

5. Admit Patient
6. Discharge Patient
7. Prescribe Treatment
8. View Medical History
9. Assign Ward/Room

### 📌 **Actor–Use Case Associations:**

* **Patient** → Register Patient, View Medical History, Schedule Appointment
* **Doctor** → Prescribe Treatment, View Medical History, Manage Patient Records
* **Receptionist** → Register Patient, Schedule Appointment, Generate Bill, Admit Patient, Discharge Patient, Assign Ward/Room
* **Admin** → Manage Patient Records, Generate Bill, Assign Ward/Room

### 📌 **<<include>> Relationships:**

* Schedule Appointment `<<include>>` Register Patient
* Generate Bill `<<include>>` Discharge Patient

---

### 📌 **<<extend>> Relationships:**

* View Medical History `<<extend>>` Prescribe Treatment
* Admit Patient `<<extend>>` Schedule Appointment

---

### 📌 **Generalization (Optional):**

* Admin and Receptionist can be generalized under **Hospital Staff**

---

### 📌 **System Boundary:**

* Label as: **Hospital Management System**

### 🛠️ **Instructions to Draw in StarUML:**

1. Open StarUML → New Use Case Diagram
2. Draw a system boundary box named **Hospital Management System**
3. Add actors: **Patient**, **Doctor**, **Receptionist**, **Admin** outside the box
4. Add the 9 use cases **inside** the system
5. Connect actors to their respective use cases with solid lines
6. Use dotted arrows and labels to show `<<include>>` and `<<extend>>` relationships
7. Use generalization arrow (triangle head) if you include a **Hospital Staff** base actor
